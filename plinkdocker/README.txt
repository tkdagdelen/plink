Plinkdockerfile
===============

This dockerfile should create a PLINK image that can be used on any computer, provided the computer has docker installed and an internet connection.  

# Requirements: 

## Notes the docker documentation: 

Docker requires a 64-bit installation regardless of your Ubuntu version. Additionally, your kernel must be 3.10 at minimum. The latest 3.10 minor version or a newer maintained version are also acceptable.

Kernels older than 3.10 lack some of the features required to run Docker containers. These older versions are known to have bugs which cause data loss and frequently panic under certain conditions.
